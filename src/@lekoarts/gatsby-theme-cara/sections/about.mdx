## About 

5 yrs. of experience in developing applications /testing and establishing my problem solving and analytical skills. 5 yrs. of IT training experience in programming languages like PHP, JavaScript, Java, C, C++ and web tools like HTML5,CSS3.

I do this for a living and love what I do as every day there is something new and exciting to learn.In my spare time, the web development community is a big part of my life. Whether teaching code to kids at a local school, managing online programming groups and blogs or attending a conference, I find keeping involved helps me stay up to date. This is also my chance to give back to the community that helped me get started, a place I am proud to be part of. Besides programming I love spending time with friends and family and can often be found together going out catching the latest movie, staying in playing games on the sofa or planning a trip to someplace I've never been before.

I graduated from a Annamalai university and got a first class degree with honours. While I was at university I worked many web design projects along with my friends that helped me to further hone in my skills as a developer. My job involves doing what I love, Developing new websites/applications and teaching new technologies. I spend a lot of time learning new techniques and actively help other people learn web development through a variety of help groups and writing web development tutorials for my website and blog about advancements in web design and development.
